# oh-my-node

old-school middleware ssr application with pug renderer

qnd-rules: no tests, no comments :)

omitting repository pattern to work with domain layer

todo:

- feedback listview
- feedback detailview

- jwt api
- sendgrid mail templates
- user signup, with profile information
- user login
- user listview
- user detailview
- user edit profile

- internal dashboard for authenticated users

maybe then ?

- sampler factory to measure cpu/ram
- send samples via socketio to dashboard
- chartjs demo with sample data
