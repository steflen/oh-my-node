# oh-my-node

old-school middleware ssr application with pug renderer
just a hobby project that does not care about spa and redux ;)

some notes for myself: 

remarks for me: omitting repository pattern to work with domain layer

much todo:

- feedback listview
- feedback detailview
- jwt api
- sendgrid mail templates
- user signup, with profile information
- user login
- user listview
- user detailview
- user edit profile
- internal dashboard for authenticated users
- build sampler factory to measure some stuff (cpu/ram)
- send samples via socketio to dashboard
- chartjs demo with sampled data
- host it somewhere
